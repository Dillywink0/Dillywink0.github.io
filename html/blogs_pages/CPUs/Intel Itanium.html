	<p>The Itanium processor, also known as IA-64, was a 64-bit processor architecture developed by Intel and HP.
        It was intended for high-performance computing and enterprise-level servers. 
        However, the Itanium processor faced challenges in terms of performance and software compatibility, 
        especially when compared to the x86 architecture. As a result, its market share declined over time.
         In 2017, Intel announced the discontinuation of future Itanium processor development, signaling the end of its commercial viability.</p>

         <p>The Itanium series did face mulitiple challenges during it's tracion on the market:</p>

         <p>In the early days, the Itanium processor series did not deliver the performance gains that were initially expected. 
            It was designed with a new architecture that aimed to achieve high performance through parallel processing and optimization for specific workloads.</p>

        <p> Itanium's architecture was significantly different from the x86 architecture, 
            which meant that software needed to be specifically developed or ported to run on Itanium processors.</p>

        <p> The Itamium Series during their run were expensive, thus making the series less attractive for mainstream applications and consumer markets.
            Along with high cost of the processors and associated infrastructure which limited the adoption of Itanium-based systems.

At times, basic prints/logs are just about the right debugging strategy. Sure, we have debuggers and  REPLs which are super useful, but sometimes you just know that sprinkling your code with a handful of temporary prints/…</p>
